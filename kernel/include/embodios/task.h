/* EMBODIOS Real-Time Task Scheduler
 *
 * Priority-based preemptive scheduler with real-time support.
 * Implements priority scheduling with round-robin for equal priorities,
 * deadline-aware priority boosting, and priority inheritance protocol.
 *
 * Features:
 * - 32 priority levels (0=highest, 31=lowest)
 * - Preemptive scheduling with configurable time quantum
 * - Deadline-aware scheduling with automatic priority boosting
 * - Priority inheritance protocol for resource synchronization
 * - Nestable preemption control for critical sections
 * - Priority inversion detection and mitigation
 * - Comprehensive scheduling statistics
 *
 * Scheduling Algorithm:
 * 1. Priority-based: Higher priority tasks run first (0 > 31)
 * 2. Round-robin: Equal priority tasks share CPU time (10 tick quantum)
 * 3. Deadline boosting: Tasks approaching deadline (<10 ticks) boosted to priority 0
 * 4. Priority inheritance: Tasks holding resources inherit waiting task priority
 *
 * Reference: FreeRTOS scheduler, Linux CFS, PREEMPT_RT patches
